There's a debate I find myself having at least twice a year for the last, oh, 20 years. In fact, at one start-up, I found myself having this debate at least every week.

It goes something like this: 

* All software gets cheaper over time due to competitive forces.
* Thus all margins for the producers of software shrink towards 0 over time.
* And therfore there's not really any good long-term prospects for businesses that seek to generate revenue from software.

Now, remember, before we go further: I've been hearing this argument for 20 years.

Before we go further, do you ever bake?

The [oldest known oven in the world is 6500 years old](https://archaeologynewsnetwork.blogspot.com/2014/08/6500-year-old-oven-unearthed-in-croatia.html#2qF3vG8Up1Bpp22Q.97). So we, humans, have been baking for at least that long. And the funny thing is, no 2 bakers ever seem to produce exactly the same bake.

Sure, you maybe have the recipe from your mother for those cookies she always made. You and your kids make them every once in a while, and you love them because they're "just like when you were a kid."  But they're not. You know they aren't. Not exactly. Because something about the way you and your kids bake that recipe is just different enough from the way your mom did it that the cookies just never quite taste like mom's. That's ok. The cookies are still good.  They're just not the same.

Software Development is a lot like baking.

In 2003, I was leading a small software dev team at a VOIP company in Chicago.  It was a good team, but a team full of developers with varying levels of skills and abilities. Probably even more importantly, the members of the team all had different interests. Different passions. And so these varying people designing systems and writing code would result in varying products of work. So I sought to set standards. I created, basically, recipes for how things should be done. Style guides. Coding standards. Preferred design patterns. I thought if I created enough rules - again, recipes - then the variation in the work product would be reduced.

And I was right. Particularly in terms of _quality_, the variations were reduced. But the variations in _style_ remained. Now, the layman user may not have easily spotted the variations, but the members of the team could always see it. We could all see it then, and that's been true on every team I've ever worked with since.
