Hi. I'm Matt Quirion. I'm interested in tech, biz, golf, football, data, sci-fi, entertainment, anything that will get me on a beach, and finding ways to keep from getting pigeon-holed. 

On this site, you can find links to my CV, my social-media accounts, and various thoughts that I've bothered to actually write down.
